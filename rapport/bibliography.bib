	abstract = {Realizing quantum speedup for practically relevant, computationally hard problems is a central challenge in quantum information science. Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the Maximum Independent Set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm's performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins.},

The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

The emphasis of this paper is on graph applications in computer science. To demonstrate the importance of graph theory in computer science, this article addresses most common applications for graph theory in computer science.

In map generalization, the appropriate selection and application of procedures (such as merging, exaggeration, and selection) require information at the geometric, attribute, and topological levels. This article highlights the potential of graph theoretic representations in providing the topological information necessary for the efficient and effective application of specific generalization procedures. Besides ease of algebraic manipulation, the principal benefit of a graph theoretic approach is the ability to detect and thus preserve topological characteristics of map objects such as isolation, adjacency, and connectivity. While it is true that topologically based systems have been developed for consistency checking and error detection during editing, this article emphasizes the benefits from a map-generalization perspective. Examples are given with respect to specific generalization procedures and are summarized as a partial set of rules for potential inclusion in a cartographic knowledge-based system.},
